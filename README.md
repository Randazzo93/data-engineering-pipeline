# Remo Health Data Engineer Project Assessment

### Summary

This assessment consists of 3 phases. How you choose to solve and present the deliverables for these phases is completely up to you. Feel free to use any tooling you feel comfortable with, however, be prepared to explain your reasoning behind your choices! Most importantly, have fun! You'll notice the instructions are purposefully vague and sparse in some areas. This assessment is designed to facilitate a conversation about your experience and style of solutioning data-related problems!

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline

Using publicly available data of your choosing, whether via a static dataset or API, build a data pipeline. It can be as simple or as complex as you choose. As previously mentioned, feel free to use any tooling at your disposal! At the minimum, the pipeline should focus on acquiring the data and shipping it to some destination for further utilization.

Keep in mind the following phases when considering the domain and dimensions of your data!

### Phase 2: Fact & Dimension Table

This phase is purposefully open-ended and the instructions very terse.

- Develop a fact table with your data.
- Develop a dimension table with your data.

### Phase 3: Sample Presentation Layer

Now's your chance to get creative and showcase how you might present this data for insights and additional analysis. Feel free to use readily available tools for presenting your data.
